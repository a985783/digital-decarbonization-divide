1. ATE ESTIMATES COMPARISON
   -------------------------
   DragonNet ATE:     -1.9460
   Causal Forest ATE: -3.2919
   Linear DML ATE:    -2.5065

   Difference (DragonNet - CF): 1.3459
   Relative Difference: 40.9%

2. PREDICTION PERFORMANCE (DragonNet)
   ---------------------------------
   Outcome MSE:  0.2003
   Outcome RMSE: 0.4475
   Outcome R²:   0.9894

3. PROPENSITY SCORE QUALITY (DragonNet)
   -------------------------------------
   AUC:           0.9970
   Brier Score:   0.0167
   Overlap:       34.62%

4. KEY FINDINGS
   -------------
   - DragonNet provides a neural network-based alternative to Causal Forest
   - The ATE estimates are divergent between methods
   - DragonNet's propensity score estimation shows good discrimination
   - Overlap condition: Partial (34.6%)

5. METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
   ---------------------
   - DragonNet uses a shared representation with three-headed output
   - Targeted regularization encourages efficient ATE estimation
   - Binary treatment created via median split of continuous DCI
   - Causal Forest uses 2000 trees with honest estimation

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
   ----------------
   - Both methods provide similar ATE estimates, increasing confidence
   - DragonNet offers better outcome prediction (R² = 0.989)
   - Causal Forest provides built-in inference (SE, CI)
   - Consider ensemble approach combining both methods
