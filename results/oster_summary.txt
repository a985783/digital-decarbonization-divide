OSTER SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - PAPER SUMMARY
======================================================================

1. METHODOLOGY
   We implement Oster's (2019) sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness
   of our IV estimate to potential omitted variable bias. The analysis
   calculates the breakdown point (delta*), which represents how much stronger
   omitted variables would need to be relative to observed controls to explain
   away the estimated treatment effect.

2. KEY RESULTS
   - IV Estimate: -273.705
   - Observed R-squared: 0.7799
   - Sample Size: 800 observations

3. SENSITIVITY FINDINGS
   Assuming a maximum R-squared of 0.950 (1.3 times the observed R-squared),
   omitted variables would need to be 1.01 times as important as the
   observed controls to explain away the IV estimate.

4. INTERPRETATION
   The IV estimate is MODERATELY ROBUST to omitted variable bias.
   Omitted variables would need to be stronger than the observed controls
   to explain away the result, suggesting that unobserved confounding is
   unlikely to fully account for our findings.

5. COMPARISON TO CONVENTIONAL THRESHOLDS
   - delta = 1.0: Omitted variables equally important as observed controls
   - Our delta = 1.01: Omitted variables 1.01x as important

   Conventional wisdom suggests delta > 1 indicates robustness (Altonji et al. 2005;
   Oster 2019). Our estimate exceeds this threshold, supporting the causal
   interpretation of the DCI-CO2 relationship.

6. RECOMMENDED PAPER TEXT
   "To assess sensitivity to omitted variable bias, we implement Oster's (2019)
   methodology. The breakdown point analysis indicates that omitted variables
   would need to be 1.01 times as important as observed controls to
   explain away our IV estimate of -273.705. This suggests our findings are
   moderately robust to potential unobserved
   confounding."
